# Agent instructions

Start at [specs/_index.md](specs/_index.md) for an overview of the specs and their status before making design decisions or writing code — it lists each spec and whether it's settled ("Stable") or still open ("Draft"/"Not started").

## Testing

- Write functional tests: exercise what a feature/function actually does (inputs → outputs, state changes, side effects), not just that it runs or matches its signature.
- Avoid trivial/tautological tests — e.g. asserting a constant, asserting an object is not `None`, asserting a mock was called. If a test would pass for a broken implementation, it's not worth writing.
- Prefer driving the public API the way a real caller would over asserting on internals.

## Implementation plans

- Write implementation plans as files in the [plans](plans/) folder.
- Name each file `YYYYMMDDHHmm_plan-title.md`: a compact date-time prefix, then an underscore, then a kebab-case title (words separated by `-`).
  - Example: `202607201830_world-registry-refactor.md`

## Verification

After any code change, run linting, type checking, and tests, and fix any failures before considering the work done.
